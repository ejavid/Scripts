Ths script locates any files that ends with .egp and then open it as a zip file so the content in these files can ben minipulated or extracted 
import zipfile 
import os 
import pandas as pd 
destination = ""Where you want to save the zip files"
Tables = []
for root, dirs, files in os.walk("Location you want to search"):
  for file in files:
    file = file.upper()
    if file.endswith(".EGP"):
      path = os.path.join(root, file)
      with zipfile.ZipFile(path) as zf:
        zf.extractall(destination)
        
        After storing these files in the destination folder you will need another loop to locate the .SAS files so you can see the content 
 for root, dirs, files in os.walk(destination):
  for file in files:
    file = file.upper()
    if file.endswith(".SAS")
    path2 = os.path.join(root, file)
    with open (path2, "r") as f:
      for line in f:
        for word in line.split():
          words = word.upper()
          if words.startswith("Words you are looking for"):
            final = [path, words]
            Tables.append(final)
